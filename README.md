# Front-End-Capstone
RnR (Rent N' Ride) - A Personal Rental Service

This app will allow a user to search a database of automobiles, boats, motorcycles and atvs.  The user will be able to select a ride and rent that ride from a private owner.  This app will also allow a user to create an account in order to list their own ride to the site that can be rented by other users.

OVERVIEW OF APP

 I will implement AngularJS, firebase data and firebase authentication in order to complete the user experience and proper functionality.  The user should be able to navigate through the app with ease and clarity.  The product owner will be able to do the same, however they will have an account in order to list their product.
